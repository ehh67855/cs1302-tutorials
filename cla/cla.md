# Command-Line Arguments

![Approved for: Fall 2021](https://img.shields.io/badge/Approved%20for-Fall%202021-blue)

Many of the programs that you've interacted with on Unix supported extra options
and/or required extra information when you entered their commands at the terminal
shell. For example, consider the following `javac` command:

```
$ javac -d bin -cp bin src/cs1302/example/Hello.java
```

The text that is entered immediately following `javac`, in the example above, is
passed into the program as __command-line arguments__. This allows the `java` program
to proceed with execution without prompting the user for input. We can have our Java
programs take in command-line arguments as well. Let's try it!

1. Create a directory for this tutorial called `cs1302-cla`, then change into it.

1. Create a `src` and `bin` directory, then create a class called `ArgTester` in 
   a package called `cs1302.cla` such that `src` is the _default package for source code_.
   
1. In your `ArgTester` class, add the following `main` method:

   ```java
   public static void main(String [] args) {
       System.out.println("arguments:");
       for (int i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
           String arg = args[i];
           System.out.printf("arg%d = %s\n", i, arg);
       } // for
   } // main
   ```
   
1. Take a few minutes to carefully read through the code above. Try and understand what it's doing.
   Note: Up until this point, you've always typed `String[] args` as a parameter to `main` but you've
   never used it. That parameter is a reference to an array of command-line arguments.

1. Compile the `ArgTester` class, specifying `bin` as the _default package for compiled code_.

1. Run `cs1302.cla.ArgTester` as usual using the `java` command. Here is what the command looks
   like with the expected program output, assuming you are running it from the `cs1302-cla`
   directory: 
   
   ```
   $ java -cp bin cs1302.cla.ArgTester
   arguments:
   ```
   
   As you can see, no iterations of the for-loop executed. This is expected as the `args` array would
   be empty in this scenario (there are no command-line arguments provided).  
   
1. Now try the following command:

   ```
   $ java -cp bin cs1302.cla.ArgTester one two three
   ```
   
   What happened? It looks like the for-loop iterated. The array referred to by `args` is not
   empty. That's right, we've actually used the `args` array for something! Here's the
   expected output:
   
   ```
   arguments:
   arg0 = one
   arg1 = two
   arg2 = three
   ```
   
   In Java, the `args` array of a standard `main` method is used to capture command-line
   arguments and make them available to the program.
   
1. Now that we see how to access the command-line arguments in our code, let's see how
   different command-line arguments are parsed. Try the following commands:
   
   ```
   $ java -cp bin cs1302.cla.ArgTester "one two" three
   ```
   
   ```
   $ java -cp bin cs1302.cla.ArgTester --help "some topic"
   ```
   
   ```
   $ java -cp bin cs1302.cla.ArgTester --string "my \"awesome\" day"
   ```
   
2. That's it! The rest is purely in the realm of code. We've shown you how command-line
   arguments are passed into a Java program (i.e., via the `args` array). Now, experiment
   by adding some command-line options of your own.
